# Link++
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Existing interlinking tools focus on finding similarity relationships between entities of distinct RDF datasets by generating owl:sameAs links.
These approaches address the detection of equivalence relations between entities.
However, in some contexts, more complex relations are required, and the links to be defined follow more sophisticated patterns.
We introduce <b>Link++</b>, an approach that enables the discovery of complex links in a flexible manner.
<b>Link++</b> enables the users to generate rich links by defining custom functions and linking patterns that fit their needs.
