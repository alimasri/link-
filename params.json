SNCF is a railway company in France see http://www.sncf.com/.\r\n  The data was downloaded from http://gtfs.s3.amazonaws.com/sncf_20131211_1451.zip\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><i>velib.ttl</i> a turtle file containing data about VELIB's bike station data. VELIB is a bike sharing company in France http://en.velib.paris.fr/. The data was downloaded from http://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/stations-velib-disponibilites-en-temps-reel/\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><i>linking-rule</i> a sample linking rule with a goal of connecting data entities that are X kilometers apart.\r\n  Note that this file can be changed to fit any other linking task based on the user's need</li>\r\n  <li><i>output-pattern</i> a sample file specifying what connection pattern a user wants as an output for a given matching task.\r\n  In this scenario the output pattern generated information about the calculated distance and the duration between two transportation entities.\r\n  <li><i>classes</i> a folder containing a compiled version of any function a user needs for a linking task.\r\n  Users may use any external library as well but it is required that the used library exists in the classes folder.</li>\r\n  <li><i>output</i> a folder containing the output of a linking process</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Publications</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Ali Masri, Karine Zeitouni, Zoubida Kedad, Gabriel Képéklian:<b> Link++: A Flexible and Customizable Tool for Connecting RDF Data Sources.</b> ESWC (Satellite Events) 2016: 107-111<br />Link: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-47602-5_22\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\r\nThis work is part of a PhD thesis supported by VEDECOM Institute http://vedecom.fr/en/ in collaboration with the University of Versailles Saint-Quentine-en-Yvelines - DAVID Laboratory http://www.david.uvsq.fr/.\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Contact information</h3>\r\nFor more information about the project or for any suggestions you are free to contact us at ali.masri@vedecom.fr",
